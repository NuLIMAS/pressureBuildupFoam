Application
    pressureDisplacementFoam is used solved to solve pore pressure buildup
    and calculate the onset of residual liquefaction 

Description
    The solver in addition to biotFoam  solves an lapalacian equation  for the pore pressure
    buildup. Also, the onset of residual liquefaction can be predicted.
