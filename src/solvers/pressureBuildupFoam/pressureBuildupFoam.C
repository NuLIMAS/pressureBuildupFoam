Application
    pressureDisplacementFoam is used solved to solve pore pressure buildup
    and calculate the onset of residual liquefaction 

Description
    Transient segregated finite-volume solver of the Biot consolidation equations 
	for linear-elastic, small-strain deformation of a solid skeleton coupled with 
    pore water flow and pressure governed by Darcy's law.

    Simple linear elasticity structural analysis code.
    Solves for the displacement vector field D and the pore water pressure p. 
    Also generating the stress tensor field sigma.
